abstract: >
  While economic factors in directed technical and scientific change have been widely studied,
  the role of teacher-directed scientific change has received less attention. This paper studies
  teacher-directed scientific change for one of the largest changes in the direction of research,
  the Scientific Revolution. Specifically, the paper considers the case of the English Scientific
  Revolution at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge during 1600–1720. It argues that
  exposure to different teachers shaped students’ direction of research and can partly account
  for the successful trajectory of English science. For this, the paper introduces a novel dataset
  on the universe of 111,242 students at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and their
  publications. Using natural language processing, the paper derives a measure of researchers’
  direction of research. To derive causal estimates of teacher-student effects, the paper uses an
  instrumental variable design that predicts students’ choice of college based on their home regions,
  a stacked differences-in-differences approach exploiting teachers leaving their college, and a
  natural experiment based on the expulsion of teachers following the English Civil War. The
  paper finds empirical evidence of teacher-directed change in the English Scientific Revolution.
  These results illustrate how teacher-directed change can contribute to paradigm change. 

summary: >
  This paper studies teacher-directed scientific change during the Scientific Revolution. It shows that teachers at seventeenth century Oxford and Cambridge shaped students’ direction of research.
