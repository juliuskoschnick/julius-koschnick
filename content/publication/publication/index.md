abstract: >
  Economic societies emerged during the late eighteenth century. We argue that these institutions
  reduced the costs of accessing useful knowledge by adopting, producing, and diffusing new ideas.
  Combining location information for the universe of 3,300 members across active economic societies
  in Germany with those of patent holders and World's Fair exhibitors, we show that regions with
  more members were more innovative in the late nineteenth century. This long-lasting effect of
  societies arguably arose through agglomeration economies and localized knowledge spillovers.
  To support this claim, we provide evidence suggesting an immediate increase in manufacturing,
  an earlier establishment of vocational schools, and a higher density of highly skilled mechanical
  workers by the mid-nineteenth century in regions with more members. We also show that regions
  with members from the same society had higher similarity in patenting, suggesting that social
  networks facilitated spatial knowledge diffusion and, to some extent, shaped the geography of innovation.
