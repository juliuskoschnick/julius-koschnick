For some reflections on technology, skills, and the age of sail after my voyage on the Götheborg as part of the crew, take a look at this Twitter thread:

I am further glad that there is an active interest in maritime history within our field of economic history. Please find a small collection of publications on maritime economic history:

- North, D. (1958). Ocean freight rates and economic development 1730-1913. The Journal of Economic History, 18(4), 537-555.
- Harley, C. K. (1971). The shift from sailing ships to steamships, 1850–1890: a study in technological change and its diffusion. In Essays on a mature economy: Britain after 1840 (pp. 215-237). Routledge.
- - Pascali, L. (2017). The wind of change: Maritime technology, trade, and economic development. American Economic Review, 107(9), 2821-2854.
- Kelly, M., & Ó Gráda, C. (2019). Speed under sail during the early industrial revolution (c. 1750–1830). The Economic History Review, 72(2), 459-480.
- Arteaga, F., Desierto, D., & Koyama, M. (2024). Shipwrecked by rents. Journal of Development Economics, 168, 103240.
- Miotto, M., & Pascali, L. (2025). Solving the longitude puzzle: A story of clocks, ships and cities. Journal of International Economics, 155, 104067.

Beyond that, in my humble opinion, these two classics cannot miss in such a list:
- Rodger, N. A. M. (1999). The safeguard of the sea: A naval history of Britain, 660–1649 (Vol. 1). W. W. Norton.
- Rodger, N. A. M. (2005). The command of the ocean: A naval history of Britain, 1649–1815 (Vol. 2). W. W. Norton.


The list is unauthorative and just intended as a simple help for anyone interested in maritime history. Should I have missed a (your) publication, please send me an email and I will be most happy to add it to the list.
